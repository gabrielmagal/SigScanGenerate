# SigScanGenerate
This is a sigscan generate project dedicated to studies! 

# Summary
The SigScan method is used to search a sequence of bytes in the process memory, in order to update memory addresses.
In the vast majority of cases we only have the sequence of bytes and we would have to assemble the pattern and mask manually, so this is the purpose of this application, to generate this automatically for you having only the sequence of bytes.
